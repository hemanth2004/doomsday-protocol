This includes a variety of important digital tools and resources like 
1. Wikipedia
2. Open Street Maps
3. Popular survival guides, emergency communication guides, medical guides, etc.
4. More books and educational content
5. A portable linux distro 
6. A simple language model (LLM)
7. The required tools to make use of these resources, like a map viewer, wikipedia dump reader, offline llm inference tool, etc.

These resources are seperated into multiple "Tiers" which are based on the **importance of the resource** vs **the size of the file**, which translates to the amount of time it takes to download.
