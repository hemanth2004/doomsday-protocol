>The doomsday protocol is a tool for downloading and procuring the world's most important resources available on the open internet in case of a global catastrophe that wipes out the internet or access to it.

### Features the protocol provides:
- We provide our curated set of *default* resources.
- These default resources are separated into multiple categories based on the **importance of the resource** versus **the size of the file**.
- Users can add their own resources to the protocol by providing a URL, a name, and a description.
- Users can also add custom guides for these resources they set up, which can be read in the app.
