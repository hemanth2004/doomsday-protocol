# wikipedia-guide

There exists 2 steps to this
1. Downloading the wikipedia dump
2. Using an offline tool to read the wikipedia dump

And we make sure this offline tool is something simple, low-level and works on a wide range of platforms.

Theres two types of Wikipedias. 
1. The original, entire wikipedia.
2. A variation of wikipedia called the simple wikipedia which holds almost all of the important articles as the original wikipedia, but is also a lot lesser in content.

The doomsday-protocol suggests using the simple wikipedia, as it is a lot smaller in size and can be downloaded in a matter of minutes.

There of course exists a way to opt for the original wikipedia, but it is a lot bigger and takes a lot more time to download.

This is a tradeoff you must make. And all of this information is only in English, to keep it as compact as possible.
