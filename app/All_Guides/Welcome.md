The doomsday protocol is a tool for downloading and procuring the world's most important resources available on the open internet in case of a global catastrophe that wipes out the internet or access to it.

### Features the protocol provides:
1. We provided our set of *default* resources which are curated for these scenarios.

2. These default resources are seperated into multiple "Tiers" which are based on the **importance of the resource** vs **the size of the file**, which translates to the amount of time it takes to download.

3. Users can add their own resources to the protocol, by providing a URL, a name and a description. 

4. Users can also add custom guides for these resources they setup, which can be read in the app.
